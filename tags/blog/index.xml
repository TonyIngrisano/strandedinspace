      <description>On 05-03-2020 our intrepid travelers encountered an anomaly in the fabric of space-time. We here at Mission Control do not speculate on that which cannot be proven. Instead, we will let our readers explore their own conclusions; but before the fringe starts losing their shit on Twitter, we encourage all to remember that our cosmonauts are technically alien in their current location.</description>

      <description>Helen Sharman is AMAZING! She was the first British astronaut and the first woman to visit MIR Space Station! A chemist, Sharman accompanied Sergei Krikalev on the Soyuz TM-12 as a Research Cosmonaut at only 27 years old, and she brought along a bag of 25,000 pansy seeds to test their subjectivity to cosmic radiation.
Flamingo Cosmonaut 501-639 is proud to be nicknamed after Sharman, and embarked upon her journey into outer space with a Cadmium Yellow Medium colored Ranunculus plant on her back!</description>

      <title>Space Travel is Treacherous</title>

      <description>Mission Control received a downlink transmission on 5-4-2020 reporting sweeping losses in Cosmonaut 501-639&amp;rsquo;s payload. It is going to take significant time to rectify this loss and unravel the Five W&amp;rsquo;s remotely. Our team is scrambling to send a Zoologist to join the gang, we hadn&amp;rsquo;t anticipated needing such a specialist, but now the question looms heavy: Are there deer or rabbits in space?</description>
